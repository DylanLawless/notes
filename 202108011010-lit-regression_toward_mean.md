Galton used regression towards mediocrity to support the claim that some biological features are resistant to evolutionary change.
His measurements used the mid-height of parents compared to children's height.
The mean height of the chilren was closer to the mean of of all children 
than the mean height of their parents to the mean height of their parents to all parents.
He also found that for _tall_ children samples, the mean height of their parents was closer to the mean of all parents rather than the mean of _tall_ children.
He thought this was an  genetic phenomenon, such that a phenotype would "regress towards mediocrity".
Instead it is a statistical feature, which is now instrumental to the modern world, including genetics and medicine.

Altman and Bland perfectly state the modern understanding;
>"If we take each group of mid-parents by height and calculate the mean height of their children, these means will lie close to a straight line. This line came to be called the regression line, and hence the process of fitting such lines became known as â€œregression."
