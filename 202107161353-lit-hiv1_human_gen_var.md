Sections that I am not reviewing, include the following notesL

Variations in probability of infection.
In this they go through the host genetics role for this probability.

Host CCR5 deletion modulating viral binding.
Cell cycle, including binding, release of RNA, reverse transcription into viral DNA, and integration into human host.
Possible to inhibit the viral parts of life cycle but not possiible to treat the integrated DNA part of life cycle.
I am sure there are many papers about crispr type treatments in the future.
Viral proteins degrated by proteasome and presented on MHC class I (encoded by HLA class I (HLA-B*57:01, HLA-C, HLA-A)).
Presented to cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL), and thereby eliminated by host immune response. 
Many candidate gene studies done but most of them discovered not to be valid. 
Only the CCR5 and HLA genes were statistically valid for assocciation in these early studies, and first GWAS. 




## Within-host diversity and epitope presentation

Impact of specific class I HLA alleles on HIV progression
* population level
* individual level (within-host diversity)

Individuals carrying two different alleles at all three class I genes associated with a reduced time to AIDS.

Supported by a GWAS: individuals carrying different HLA alleles at each class I gene had a significantly lower viral load than homozygous individuals.

Heterozygote advantage: likely due to presenting more HIV epitopes than homozygote.

In silico study
* the binding affinity of all possible 9-mer peptides in the HIV proteome 
* to HLA proteins encoded by the different class I alleles
*  set point viral load (spVL) was negatively correlated with the breadth of the peptide repertoire bound by an individual’s HLA protein isoforms.
* However, quantity of epitopes alone is unlikely to fully explain the protective capacity of an individual’s HLA alleles.
* Subsets of epitopes that are uniquely presented by protective HLA isoforms explainedmore than the entire predicted set. 
* Furthermore, HIV epitopes that encode structurally important residues are preferentially targeted by protective HLA isoforms 
	- associate with elite control.

_Quantity and quality of HIV epitopes presented by combinations of HLA isoforms are the key drivers of spVL._

> a | HIV-infected cells expressing protective HLA-B alleles tend to present a more diverse and more structurally conserved set of HIV epitopes compared to non-protective alleles. Interactions with protective alleles tend to produce a more polyfunctional cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. b | HLA-C protein isoforms vary broadly in their level of expression on the surface of infected cells. HLA-C alleles that do not have a binding site for microRNA-148a (miRNA-148a) in the 3′ untranslated region of their mRNAs escape suppression and present more peptide on the cell surface than alleles with an miRNA-148a binding site, resulting in the initiation of stronger CTL responses. c | Different HLA-A alleles express different amounts of HLA-A signal peptide, which positively correlates with HLA-E peptide expression. HLA-E interacts with the NKG2A receptor on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and, when highly expressed, inhibits the killing of infected cells.

## Non-classical effects of HLA variation

Variable expression levels of classical HLA-C alleles linked to HIV control.

* High expression protects against disease progression.
	- across ancestries 
	- linked to the absence of a variable microRNA-148a (miR-148a) binding site in the 3′ untranslated region of HLA-C.
	- proposed: mRNA lacking miR-148a binding site are not suppressed, load more HIV epitopes, and detected by CTL (**Figure 2b**).


HLA-A expressed at variable level on cell surface.
* High levels associate with poorer control of viral replication,
* faster disease progression.
* Proposed: enhanced production of the HLA class I signal peptide that regulates HLA-E expression
	- HLA-E is a ligand for natural killer group protein 2A (NKG2A) 
	- interaction results in strong inhibition of natural killer (NK) cell degranulation (**Figure 2c**).
* Enhanced production of the HLA class I signal peptide may lead to enhanced inhibition of immune responses. 

The combination of HLA genotype and the expression of particular killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) proteins variably modulated HIV disease course.
*  KIR proteins - highly variable cell-surface receptors 
	- expressed on NK cells (some T cells)
	- when engaged by their cognate receptors, either activate or inhibit NK cell-mediated killing 
* Combination of the activating KIR3DS1 allele with a set of HLA-B alleles that carry isoleucine in the Bw4 epitope (Bw4-I80) is highly associated with HIV control.

_These are examples of the complex interplay between epitope presentation, HLA protein expression and NK inhibition._
